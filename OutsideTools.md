2. Arrow Wing Wave Drag - Since a glider is a sub sonic tool no need for it.
Closed form solution for the wave drag of an arrow or delta wing with sharp edges based on work of Rogers and Puckett and Stewart.  / ROGERS

4. Eppler
The well-known Eppler airfoil program including boundary layer analysis.  / EPPLER
5. NACA Airfoils.
The coordinates of 4-digit, 4-digit-modified, 5-digit, 6-series, and 16-series airfoils may be accurately calculated. Newly modified to present upper and lower surface points at the same x-coordinate. Totally recoded in modern Fortran using modules.  / NACA456
6. Panair (A502)
High order aerodynamic panel code. The most versatile and accurate of all the linear theory panel codes. Subsonic/supersonic solutions with linear source strength variation and quadratic doublet strength variation. Very versatile boundary condition specifications.  / PANAIR
7. Wave Drag by Area Rule
This is the famous Harris Wave Drag Program from NASA Langley.  / WAVEDRAG
8. WingBody panel code
Subsonic/Supersonic Aerodynamics of simple wing-body-tail combinations. This is the Woodward panel code that includes calculation of the wing shape for minimum drag in supersonic cruise.  / WINGBODY
